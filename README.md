# Who Turned the Lights Out?

By 50.002 Team 21 

Who Turned the Lights Out? adds an exciting twist to the classic electronic game Lights Out, by introducing different levels of difficulty to choose from.
 A player is given a 4 x 4 puzzle with some tiles lighted red and some lighted blue. The user can then press any of the 16 tiles to invert the colours of 5 tiles: the selected tile, along with 4 other tiles on the top, bottom, left and right of this tilt, from red to blue, and vice versa. A red tile represents that it is in the “on” state, a blue represents that it is in the “off” state. To complete the game, the user has to press a correct combination of buttons to turn all the tiles “on”. The goal is to solve the puzzle in the least number of steps possible.
The player can also press on the reset tile to restart the board with a new initial pattern. There are also 3 difficulty levels the player can toggle between with the difficulty button: 
Level 1: the game is played as per normal
Level 2: the board state will be hidden for every alternate move
Level 3: the board state will be hidden for two moves after each move

The 7-segment display shows the button press count on the left two displays and the current difficulty level of the game on the right-most display.
